we are use neural network model
To run this code properly, our final code, training dataset, and test dataset must be in the same location.
Our code has four main categories:
    1. clean the train data set 
        Correct temperature values.
        Assign numerical values to the kingdom names.
        Create a date column by combining the year, month, and day columns.
    2. Adjest test data set
        Assign the same numerical values for the kingdoms.
        Create a date column by combining the year, month, and day columns.
    3. Train the model using a neural network.
    4. Predict values for the given test dataset.
